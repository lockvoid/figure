# Figure

Figure lets you put forms on static sites fast and easy; no more evil iFrame and
CSS overrides. Build forms with plain HTML and JavaScript for additional features.

Put simply, Figure gives developers and designers - tech-savvy individuals like
you - a place to point form submissions, handle the processing, transform input
data, and finally, interact with users by redirecting them to another page.

See [the announcement post](http://therondb.com/blog/introducing-figure.html) in Theronâ€™s blog.
